# HyprSTT v1.0.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** October 27, 2025

This is the first stable release of HyprSTT with critical bug fixes and significant performance improvements.

## üéâ Highlights

- ‚úÖ **Fixed broken STT functionality** - Recording toggle now works correctly
- ‚ö° **Significant performance boost** - Up to 2 seconds faster transcription by eliminating unnecessary resampling
- üìù **Complete testing framework** - Automated tests and comprehensive testing guide
- üì¶ **Fixed all dependency documentation** - All installation scripts now include complete dependency lists

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### Signal Handling Fixed
**Problem:** F9 toggle key was not working - Python signal handlers were blocked by Qt's event loop.

**Solution:** Added QTimer that wakes up the event loop every 500ms to allow signal processing.

**Impact:** STT toggle functionality now works reliably.

**Files changed:**
- `src/main.py` (lines 24, 547-549)

### Race Condition in Notifications Fixed
**Problem:** Toggle showed "Recording stopped" when starting and vice versa.

**Solution:** Removed state-based notifications from toggle-stt.sh. Python now handles all notifications based on actual state changes.

**Impact:** Notifications now correctly reflect recording state.

**Files changed:**
- `toggle-stt.sh` (lines 66-73)

## ‚ö° Performance Improvements

### Eliminated Unnecessary Resampling
**Problem:** Audio was being resampled twice:
1. Manually using scipy.signal.resample (48kHz ‚Üí 16kHz) - SLOW
2. Again internally by Whisper (to 16kHz)

**Solution:** Removed manual scipy resampling. Whisper handles resampling internally using optimized methods.

**Impact:**
- Short recordings (2-3 sec): ~200-500ms faster
- Longer recordings (10+ sec): 1-2+ seconds faster
- Removed hidden scipy dependency

**Files changed:**
- `src/audio_capture.py` - Removed resampling code, removed scipy import
- `src/whisper_processor.py` - Uses native sample rate
- `src/main.py` - Handles sample rate parameter

## üìù Testing Infrastructure

### New Testing Tools
- **test-stt.sh** - Automated test script that verifies:
  - HyprSTT is running
  - Recording starts/stops correctly
  - Transcription completes
  - Text is copied to clipboard
  - No errors in logs

- **TESTING.md** - Comprehensive testing guide with:
  - Manual testing checklists
  - Common issues and solutions
  - Regression prevention guidelines
  - Debug mode tips

### Usage
```bash
cd hyprstt && ./test-stt.sh
```

## üì¶ Dependency Fixes

All installation scripts and documentation now include complete dependency lists:

**Added to all scripts:**
- `wl-clipboard` (critical for clipboard functionality!)
- `libsndfile` (required by soundfile package)

**Files updated:**
- `install.sh` - Complete Arch and Debian dependency lists
- `quick-setup.sh` - Now uses `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `README.md` - Added missing dependencies
- `CLAUDE.md` - Expanded Dependencies & System Requirements section

## üîß Installation
