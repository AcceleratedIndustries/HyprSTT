# Hyprland Whisper STT - Distribution Instructions

This document provides instructions for distributing the updated Hyprland Whisper STT application to your team.

## What's Included in the Package

I've prepared a complete distribution package for you to share with your team. The package includes:

1. **All source code files** with the updated clipboard-based approach
2. **Configuration files** with improved settings
3. **Setup and run scripts** for easy installation
4. **Comprehensive documentation** for end users and customization
5. **Claude Code instructions** for your team to get AI assistance

## Distribution Files

The following files have been created or updated:

1. `distribution_package/` - Directory containing all files ready for distribution
2. `hyprland-whisper-stt-distribution.tar.gz` - Compressed archive ready for distribution
3. New documentation files:
   - `CUSTOMIZATION.md` - Guide for customizing the application
   - `CLAUDE-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Instructions for using Claude with this app
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Guide for deploying to team members
   - `PACKAGE-README.md` - Overview of the distribution package
   - Updated `README.md` with current features and instructions

## How to Distribute

### Option 1: Share the Compressed Archive

The simplest approach is to share the compressed archive:

1. Distribute `hyprland-whisper-stt-distribution.tar.gz` to your team
2. Team members extract it with:
   ```bash
   tar -xzvf hyprland-whisper-stt-distribution.tar.gz
   cd distribution_package
   ./quick-setup.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

### Option 2: Use a Git Repository

If your team uses Git:

1. Create a repository and push the contents of `distribution_package/`
2. Team members clone the repository and follow installation instructions

## Key Changes for Your Team

Make sure to highlight these changes to your team:

1. **New Clipboard Approach**: The application now copies text to clipboard instead of typing it directly, solving the garbled text issue
2. **Lower Audio Thresholds**: Better handling of quiet speech
3. **Unlimited Recording**: No automatic time limit on recording duration
4. **Claude Code Integration**: Team members can use Claude Code to customize the application

## Claude Code Integration

The `CLAUDE-INSTRUCTIONS.md` file is specifically designed to give Claude Code context about the application. Team members should:

1. Install Claude Code if they haven't already
2. Open Claude Code in the application directory
3. Share the Claude instructions document with Claude
4. Ask for specific customizations or troubleshooting help

## Your Role in Supporting Team Members

As the distributor, you may want to:

1. Provide a point of contact for questions
2. Schedule a demo session to show how the application works
3. Set up a channel for feedback and feature requests
4. Consider hosting a central repository for updates

## Future Updates

If you make future updates to the application:

1. Update the distribution package with new files
2. Create a new compressed archive
3. Document the changes in release notes
4. Provide clear upgrade instructions to your team

The application is now ready for distribution to your team with comprehensive documentation and customization guidance via Claude Code.
